/*'You are given a class - Complex. class Complex { public: int a,b; }; Operators are overloaded by means of operator functions, which are regular functions with special names. Their name begins with the operator keyword followed by the operator sign that is overloaded. The syntax is: type operator sign (parameters) { /*... body ...*/ } You need to overload operators + and << for the Complex class. The operator + should add complex numbers according to the rules of complex addition: (a+ib)+(c+id) = (a+c) + i(b+d)  Overload the stream insertion operator << to add "a+ib" to the stream: cout<< c << endl;'*/
Certainly! Here's an example C++ program that overloads the `+` operator and the stream insertion operator (`<<`) for the `Complex` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
public:
    int a, b;

    // Overload + operator for complex addition
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) {
        Complex result;
        result.a = a + other.a;
        result.b = b + other.b;
        return result;
    }

    // Overload << operator for stream insertion
    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Complex& c) {
        os << c.a << "+i" << c.b;
        return os;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1, c2, result;

    // Get input for complex numbers
    cout << "Enter real and imaginary parts of the first complex number: ";
    cin >> c1.a >> c1.b;

    cout << "Enter real and imaginary parts of the second complex number: ";
    cin >> c2.a >> c2.b;

    // Perform complex addition
    result = c1 + c2;

    // Display the result using overloaded stream insertion operator
    cout << "Result of addition: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `Complex` class has two data members `a` and `b` representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

2. The `+` operator is overloaded as a member function of the `Complex` class to perform complex addition.

3. The `<<` operator is overloaded as a friend function to allow streaming the `Complex` object into an output stream (e.g., `cout`).

4. In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.

5. The `+` operator is used to add the two complex numbers.

6. The result is then displayed using the overloaded `<<` operator for stream insertion.
